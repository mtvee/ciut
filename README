CIUT is a simple unit testing suite for CodeIgniter. 

You can get the code at: http://github.com/mtvee/ciut

The structure of the repo is the basic structure I use. Check out
the comments in the header of 'application/libraries/Ciut.php'
for more details. I think things should be self-explanatory.

If you have any comments/fixes/questions etc, please feel free to contact me
at the address above.

Hope this helps your coding! :)
